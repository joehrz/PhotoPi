# PhotoPi: Main System (Control & GUI)

This directory contains the source code for the main control system of PhotoPi, which runs on a user's primary computer. It provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing the image acquisition process, controlling the Raspberry Pi, and handling captured data.

For a general overview of the entire PhotoPi project, please see the [main README.md](../../README.md).

## Overview

The Main System is the central hub for interacting with the PhotoPi hardware and initiating data capture workflows. It communicates with the Raspberry Pi over SSH to control cameras and the turntable, and manages the transfer of captured images.

## Core Components

* **`gui.py`**: The main Tkinter-based GUI application allowing users to:
    * Configure imaging parameters (camera selection, plant name, turntable angle, delay).
    * Select a local folder for storing images and configuration.
    * Initiate image capture sequences.
    * Inspect test images from the cameras.
    * Manage SSH connections to the Raspberry Pi.
* **`imagecapture.py`**: Handles the logic for:
    * Sending image capture commands to the Raspberry Pi.
    * Fetching and displaying inspection images.
    * Transferring completed image sets from the Raspberry Pi to the local machine.
* **`network.py`**: Manages SSH and SFTP connections using Paramiko for communication with the Raspberry Pi.
* **`config.py`**: Handles loading and saving of session parameters to `params.json`.
* **`credentials.py`**: Manages network discovery (finding `raspberrypi.local`) and originally included a dialog for credentials (though primary credential management is now via `.env` file).
* **`params.json`**: A JSON file storing the parameters set through the GUI. This file is also transferred to the Raspberry Pi.

## Features

* User-friendly GUI for system operation.
* Dynamic SSH connection management.
* Configuration of multi-camera setups and turntable movement.
* Live image inspection from selected cameras.
* Automated image transfer from Raspberry Pi.
* Saving and loading of session parameters via `params.json`.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Required Python packages (installed via main project `setup.py` or `pip install -e .[main_system]`):
    * `pillow==10.4.0`
    * `paramiko==3.1.0`
    * `python-dotenv` (for loading `.env` file)
* SSH access to the configured Raspberry Pi.

## Configuration

1.  **`.env` File:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the PhotoPi project (one level above `photopack`). This file should contain the SSH credentials for the Raspberry Pi:
    ```env
    PI_USERNAME=your_pi_username
    PI_PASSWORD=your_pi_password
    ```
    **Important:** Add `.env` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

2.  **`params.json`:**
    This file is automatically generated and updated by the GUI when you click "Submit". It stores settings like:
    * `camera_a`, `camera_b`, `camera_c`, `camera_d`: (0 or 1) indicating if the camera is active.
    * `angle`: Turntable rotation angle per step (degrees).
    * `seconds`: Delay between turntable movements/image captures.
    * `plant_name`: Identifier for the current plant/experiment.
    * `folder_path`: Local directory to save images and `params.json`.
    * `pi_hostname`: Detected or manually entered hostname/IP of the Raspberry Pi.
    * `timestamp`, `folder_with_date`: Automatically generated for unique run identification.

## Usage

1.  Ensure your Raspberry Pi is set up, powered on, and accessible on the network.
2.  Activate your Python virtual environment if you are using one.
3.  Launch the main GUI:
    ```bash
    python -m photopack.main_system.gui
    ```
    Or, if installed with entry points:
    ```bash
    photopack-main
    ```
4.  The GUI will attempt to discover the Raspberry Pi (e.g., `raspberrypi.local`).
5.  Fill in the required fields in the GUI:
    * Select active cameras.
    * Set Plant Name, Angle, Image Capture Delay.
    * Choose a local Folder Path.
6.  Click **"Submit"**. This saves `params.json` locally and transfers it to `/home/pi/params.json` on the Raspberry Pi.
7.  Click **"Inspect Images"** (optional) to take test shots.
8.  Click **"Start Imaging"** to begin the automated capture sequence.
9.  Images will be captured on the Pi and then automatically transferred to your specified local folder.

## Troubleshooting

* **Connection Errors:**
    * Ensure the Raspberry Pi is on the same network and its hostname/IP is correct.
    * Verify `PI_USERNAME` and `PI_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.
    * Check firewall settings on your Control PC or network.
* **GUI Freezes:** If the GUI becomes unresponsive during network operations, ensure the task is properly threaded.
* **`params.json` Not Found/Incorrect:** Ensure you click "Submit" in the GUI to generate/update `params.json` before starting imaging.
